- Hi, my name is Ryan Meehan.
- I am a computer science student - and aspiring software developer - studying at Georgetown University.
- I have the most experience with C++ and Python, but over the past year, a lot of my projects have been written in JavaScript and TypeScript. I've done mobile development work for a few different start-up companies, using React Native for all of these projects. 
- Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-meehan-84070b220/).
